A new Flutter project.

A Patient Clinical Data management application for the health care providers (i.e. nurses and doctors) in hospitals. In this course, we are asked to build a mobile client for this using Flutter based on a REST API Service.

The following requirements have to be satisfied by our application:

1- App shall allow healthcare providers to add/update/view patient data to track and monitor patient records. 2- App shall allow healthcare providers to add/update/view the detailed clinical data (Historical tests) of an individual patient. 3- App shall allow healthcare providers to find any patients in critical condition. Critical conditions are determined automatically based on the latest results. 4- The clinical data can include the following information: Date/time, Type of Data, Reading/Value Data Type: Blood Pressure (X/Y mmHg) Respiratory Rate (X/min) Blood Oxygen Level (X%) Heartbeat Rate (X/min)
